InvaderR
========

Simple space invaders for iOS.

Available on the Apple app store: [free](http://itunes.apple.com/au/app/invaderr/id366183161?mt=8 "itunes")

### Details

* Controls are tilt left and right in landscape mode, tap anywhere to shoot.
* The invaders are generated by making a random 3x5 array of 'pixels' and mirroring them.
* Based on my [Windows version](https://github.com/richy486/InvaderR-Win) built in C++.
* I haven't used very much Objective-C, just for setting up and controls.

### Notes

* I have removed references to [pebblecube](http://pebblecube.com "pebblecube.com"), game center and twitter.
* I have also taken out music and images not created by me.
* There is a class called AccelerometerSimulation by Otto Chrons for testing the game with your macbook's accelerometer on the iOS simulator.
